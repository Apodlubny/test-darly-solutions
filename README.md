This is the test assignment from the Darly Solutions.
To launch app

1. clone this repo
2. install dependencies with `npm i` command
3. run server with `npm run server`
4. run `npm start` to run the App

## -The data in the table is loaded with api from the local server

- styling was made with materialUI
- the App doesn't consist of many components, so there was no need in state manager
- inputs in AddUserForm contain validation
- nanoid package is used for simple id generating
- react-icons lib is for convenient icons' usage (no need to deal with annoying svg-sprites :))
